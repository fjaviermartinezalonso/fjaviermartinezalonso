## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Javier!

From a young age, I have had an innate fascination with numbers and technology, which led me to pursue a degree in Telecommunications Engineering. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with extraordinary people and to deeply engage in the development of embedded systems focused on telecommunications.

With over 7 years of experience, I specialize in programming FPGAs (using VHDL/Verilog) and developing low-level software in C. Additionally, I have extensive experience in debugging integrated systems using laboratory instrumentation and in automating tests through Linux scripts.

On a personal level, I define myself as a straightforward and honest individual who values transparency in all aspects of life. I am passionate about continuous learning, and in my free time, I delve into web development, where I enjoy creating visually appealing and functional products, working with high-level technologies.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to contact me or explore my work on GitHub!
