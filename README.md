### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like numbers and computers since I was a kid. Because of this I decided to study Telecommunication Engineering in order to work in technology. Thanks to this I could meet awesome people too! I consider myself a straighforward person and I value honesty over everithing else.

I have more than 7 years of experience developing embedded systems oriented to telecommunications. I am used to programming FPGAs (VHDL/Verilog) and low-level software in C, debugging complete systems with the help of laboratory instrumentation, automating tests using scripts in Linux...

In my free time I like to learn about web development. I find it very satisfying to develop attractive products by programming at a higher level.
